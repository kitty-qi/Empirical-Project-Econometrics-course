Dataset is called "BWGHT50: N=694, cross-sectional individual data on birth weights (50% sample), bcuse bwght50" in this poject. 

This study examined how the smoking conditions of a pregnant mother are associated with her baby’s birth weight. The dataset is called “BWGHT50: N=694, cross-sectional individual data on birth weights (50% sample)” from the Wooldridge data sets in the book Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data, written by Jeffrey Wooldridge. Moreover, it contains data on birth weights with 694 sample individuals and 14 variables. Although many researchers have already done many experiments and surveys on finding the possible causes of low birth weight, this paper wants to consider mainly three aspects: family condition, government regulation on cigarettes, the infant’s background, like his or her gender, race, and birth order. In conclusion, this dataset and its analysis aim to find the causal relationship between birth weight disparities and smoking levels to provide suggestions on how to create an environment such that a mother could give birth to a healthy infant.
